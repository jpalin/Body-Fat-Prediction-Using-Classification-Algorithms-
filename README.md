# Body-Fat-Prediction-Using-Classification-Algorithms-
Using data on hundreds of men's body measurements such as height and weight, machine learning algorithms are used to assess if a man is in a healthy range (less than 22% body fat) 

This data was used to create a web app that when given a set of body measurements can predict if an individual is in a healthy weight range.
